The role of cranial nerves, sympathetic fibers, and evolutionary aspects of these pathways in relation to eye tracking were also discussed.\n\n\n## Detailed Summary\n\n* The sphincter pupillae muscle in the eyeball controls pupil constriction in response to light. \n* The autonomic nervous system regulates this muscle's activity, responding to brightness. \n* The oculomotor nerve (Cranial Nerve III) innervates the sphincter pupillae for constriction. \n* The optic nerve (Cranial Nerve II) detects light intensity. \n* Sympathetic fibers for pupil dilation originate in the spinal cord and travel via the superior cervical ganglion. \n* Evolutionary pathways of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems reflect a balance of speed and function. \n* Pupil size changes, though secondary, can indicate cognitive and emotional states relevant to eye tracking. \n* Eye tracking primarily focuses on translational movement but can benefit from pupil response data.\n\n\n## Tags\n\n#sphincters\n#eyeballs\n#nervous-system\n#autonomic-nervous-system\n#eye-tracking\n\n\n## Backlinks\n\n[sphincters]\n[eyeballs]\n[nervous-system]\n[autonomic-nervous-system]\n[eye-tracking]\n\n\n        "
